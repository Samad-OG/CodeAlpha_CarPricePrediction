# 🚗 Advanced Car Price Prediction Dashboard

This project is a high-precision machine learning solution developed during my Data Science internship at **CodeAlpha**. It achieves a stellar **96.68% accuracy** in predicting vehicle resale values by leveraging industrial-grade preprocessing and ensemble learning.

## 🌟 Key Highlights
- **Model Accuracy:** 96.68% (R2 Score)
- **Error Metric:** Low MAE of 0.5888, indicating high reliability
- **Explainable AI (XAI):** Integrated **SHAP Analysis** to decode model decisions
- **Robust Pipeline:** Uses Scikit-learn Pipelines with **Standard/Robust Scaling** and One-Hot Encoding

## 📊 Visual Insights
1. **Feature Importance:** Identifies 'Present Price' and 'Car Age' as the dominant market drivers
2. **Residual Analysis:** Confirms model unbiasedness through homoscedasticity checks
3. **SHAP Bee-swarm:** Provides a deep dive into how individual features (like Fuel Type or Mileage) impact the final valuation

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib, **SHAP**
- **Environment:** Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook
